## Demonstration

## Implementation Details

Swift v5.x
Xcode 12.5

There's no storyboard, and the only XIB used is to design the collection view cell.

This is the initial view controller hierachy:

    - [UINavigationController]
    |-- [ViewController layout:normal]

    normal: CollectionViewFlowLayout

When the button "Change Layout" is pressed, the view hierarchy changes to:

    - [UINavigationController]
    |-- [ViewController layout:normal]
        |--[ViewController layout:expanded]

    normal: CollectionViewFlowLayout
    expanded: CollectionViewExpandedFlowLayout

The transition is performed via a layout-to-layout transition using Apple iOS 7 API.

The "normal" layout enforces 3 items per row on iPads, and just one item for iPhones.

The "expanded" layout enforces 1 item per row, and the item's width is the same of the collection view.
